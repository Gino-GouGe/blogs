## About Me

Welcome to my blogs! My name is Gino (李硕存) and I'm original from Suzhou, China. I'm a Google Search Engineer (nowadays AI Prompt Engineer) and have been interested in Distruted System a lot. I want to learn concretely how real business needs are perfectly met by those in-perfect systems and philosophically what design trade-offs have been made to compensate particular limitations. Outside work, I like drinking coffee, making latte arts, playing retro/RTS games and playing/watching football.

I shared my learning through posts from time to time and I hope you find them helpful and resonated!
